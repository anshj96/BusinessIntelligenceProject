PART 1
CVS Health is a retail pharmacy and health care company that sells consumer products and also specializes in the pharmacy industry. We decided to choose this company for our database because there are numerous aspects of the business, which call for a much more in depth and detailed database. CVS was founded in 1963 in Lowell, Massachusetts and CVS stands for Consumer Value Stores. Over the years CVS grew quickly and just 6 years later, the company sold to Melville Corporation in 1969. Over the course of the next40 years CVS grew tremendously and in 2011 the company crossed the $100 billion mark for revenues. CVS’ business takes care of many different units. More than two thirds of CVS’ revenue come from its pharmacy division. However, it is important to note that pharmacy doesn’t only mean prescription drugs, but it also includes over the counter drugs, flu shots, all convenience sale items such as candies and cookies. CVS also has a brand called MinuteClinic which deals with medical clinic operations.
